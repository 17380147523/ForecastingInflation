Forecasting Inflation in a data-rich environment: the benefits of machine learning methods

- Required packages:
    - HDeconometrics (from my github)
    - h20
    - glmnet
    - xgboost
    - randomForest
    - lbvar (from my github)
    - boot



- This repository contains the codes used to run the rolling windows in the paper "Forecasting Inflation in a data-rich environment: the benefits of machine learning methods" by Medeiros, Vasconcelos, Veiga and Zilberman.
- Codes are divided in one folder for each subsample used in the paper.
- Each folder contains one folder with functions and one folder with codes to call and run the functions. PATHS MUST BE ADJUSTED.
- If the paths are correct, running the files in the RUN folders will start the rolling windows.
